### 3. I want to become a popular front-end developer and I am making the appropriate efforts to do this. Back in September-October 2020, I didn't know anything about JavaScript and the technologies surrounding it, and now 6 months later I already have some basic ( maybe not very basic) knowledge,0 concerning JS and its environment (html, css and etc.). On the 2020Q3 stream, I learned how to work in a team and acquired certain practical skills in both SPA development and basic algorithms, taking into account the JS syntax. I like JS and have a great desire to grow in this direction and develop further
### 4. I can write SPA in JavaScript and a little bit in React.  I think that I have a good command of CSS, HTML 5 and pure JS. I know basic things about React, typescript. I know how to use git.
### 5. I will update this item later...
